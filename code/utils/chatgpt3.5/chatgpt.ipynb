    "PROMPT_TEMPLATE='''Given a sentence and some entities connnected by periods, you are required to ask some relevant questions about the specified entities involved in the sentence, so that the questions can help to verify the factuality of the sentence.\n",
    "Questions may involve basic attributes such as colors, actions mentioned in the sentence. Do not ask questions involving object counts or the existence of object.\n",
    "When asking questions about attributes, try to ask simple questions that only involve one entity. \n",
    "When asking questions about positional relationships, must provide specific positional relationships between objects or the positional relationships of objects in the image.\n",
    "Ask questions that can be easily decided visually. Do not ask questions that require complex reasoning.\n",
    "Do not ask semantically similar questions. Do not ask questions only about scenes or places.\n",
    "Do not ask questions about uncertain or conjecture parts of the sentence, for example, the parts described with \"maybe\" or \"likely\", etc.\n",
    "It is no need to cover all the specified entities. If there is no question to ask, simply output a 'None'.\n",
    "When asking questions, do not assume the claims in the description as true in advance. Only ask questions relevant to the information in the sentence.\n",
    "Only ask questions about common, specific and concrete entities. The entities involved in the questions are limited to the range within the given entities.\n",
    "Output only one question in each line. For each line, first output the question, then a single '&', and finally entities involved in the question, still connected by periods if multiple entities are involved. The order of entities needs to be consistent with the order in which they appear in the questions.\n",
